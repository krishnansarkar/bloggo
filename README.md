2nd capstone project for [The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/).
> The purpose of Capstone projects is for you to develop the independent skills required in a professional developer. Unlike the tutorial projects at the end of the modules, capstone project give you far more freedom, but also they give you less help. There are no starting files, styling files, steps, guidance or solution code. The point is for you to build a real-life project by yourself using the skills you have acquired up to this point. We are assuming you have not skipped over any modules in the course.
